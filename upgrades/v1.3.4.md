# Kroma `v1.3.4` Upgrade Instructions

This document provides instructions to upgrade from Kroma `v1.3.1` to `v1.3.4`.
**No changes in flags have been made on this release, so you can simply change the tag for upgrade.**
For more details about `v1.3.4`, please refer the [release note](https://github.com/kroma-network/kroma/releases/tag/v1.3.4).
This upgrade mainly includes activation of fixed `KromaZKTrie` for better performance in terms of block processing.

## Guides for upgrade

### Stop Kroma

For upgrade, stop your Kroma full node or validator.
```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode down

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator down
```

### Common

You need to update your `.env` file.

First, update the tag of `kroma-node` and `kroma-validator` docker image.
```
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_GETH=v0.4.6
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_NODE=v1.3.4
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_VALIDATOR=v1.3.4
```

Also, a field is added to `geth.env`. Please make sure your `geth.eng` has the following field.
```
GETH_MINER_RECOMMIT=100ms
```

### Start Kroma

You can now start Kroma full node or validator with a new version.

```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode up -d

docker compose --profile validator up -d
```
