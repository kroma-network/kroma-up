# Kroma `v1.4.0` Upgrade Instructions

This document provides instructions to upgrade from Kroma `v1.3.4` to `v1.4.0`.

For more details about `v1.4.0`, please refer the [release note](https://github.com/kroma-network/kroma/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
This upgrade mainly includes upstream of Optimism [`v1.7.2`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/v1.7.2)
This upgrade includes Ecotone upgrade, which enables Kroma-batcher to post batch using blob-carrying transaction.
So all full nodes and validators must complete the upgrade before the Ecotone upgrade is activated.
The activation time of Ecotone upgrade is scheduled as below:

- Kroma sepolia: `Wed Apr 17 2024 08:00:00 UTC`

## Guides for upgrade

### Stop Kroma

For upgrade, stop your Kroma full node or validator.
```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode down

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator down
```

### Common

You need to update your `.env` file.

First, update the tag of `kroma-node` and `kroma-validator` docker image.
```
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_GETH=v0.5.0
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_NODE=v1.4.0
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_VALIDATOR=v1.4.0
```

Also, after activation of Ecotone, you need L1 Beacon endpoint to get blob information.

```
KROMA_NODE__L1_BEACON_ENDPOINT=
```

And Ecotone activation time should be added to `rollup.json`. Please make sure that the following field is added for 
Kroma sepolia. You can also refer the modified [`rollup.json`](../config/sepolia/rollup.json).

```json
{
  "ecotone_time": 1713340800
}
```

### Start Kroma

You can now start Kroma full node or validator with a new version.

```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode up -d

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator up -d
```
